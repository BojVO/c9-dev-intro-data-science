# Developers Intro to Data Science

## Overview

This series on [Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Dev-Intro-to-Data-Science) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHjDop2DtiCmwTTcrlwKAVHE) are designed to help you, a developer, begin your journey through understanding data science and machine learning concepts, while providing you with a practical guide to your first data steps. Whether you want to learn how to actually apply data science and machine learning to the technical solutions you're building, or just want to be able to have more effective conversations with the data scientists or machine learning experts on your team, this series will give you that initial insight and hopefully spark your interest to learn more.

We do assume you are familiar with software development, however the majority of the code shown in this series is relatively straight-forward Python. So even if you're a novice developer, you will likely learn something for your level. We also assume that you have some familiarity with Azure. 

If you're not familiar with Python, we recommend these video series:
- [Python for beginners](https://aka.ms/pythonbeginnerseries)
- [More Python for beginners](https://aka.ms/morepython)
- [Even more Python for beginners](https://aka.ms/evenmorepython)

If you're not familiar with Azure, we recommend checking out these Microsoft Learn modules:
- [Create an Azure Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account/)
- [Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/)

Remember, Azure offers free trials:
- [Azure free trial for professionals](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
- [Azure free trial for students (no credit card required](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/)

### What you'll learn

- The basic data science lifecycle
- An overview of common machine learning algorithms
- How to setup your local and cloud developer environment to:
  - Write Python in Jupyter notebooks in Visual Studio Code
  - Connect an Azure Machine Learning resource to your local Visual Studio Code environment
  - Write Python in Jupyter notebooks in Azure Machine Learning Studio
- How to import, clean, and manipulate data with Python
- How to split data and test machine learning algorithms in code

## Prerequisites

- Some software development experience
- Light experience with Python
- [An understanding of Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started)
- [Light experience with Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account/)

## Next Steps

If you want to follow along with the course without writing out all of the code (or try to find an error in your code), we have created this repository that contains all of the content that we showed in the course. 

### Getting Started with Code

We have created a folder in this repo with all of the code and instructions on how to get started with this completed code both locally in Visual Studio Code and in the clour on Azure Machine Learning Studio. You can find this [code in the project README](https://github.com/microsoft/c9-dev-intro-data-science/blob/main/regression-with-bikes/README.md).


### Course Outline

Here you will find a table for each video, the corresponding resources, and the corresponding slides. Note that some videos only had a title slide, so we did not include the links to the slides for those videos.

## After the Video Series

As the goal of this course is to help get you understand the basics of data science and machine learning, while being able to practically begin to explore those concepts in code. The next step after completing the videos is to start to explore other types of data, algorithms, and approaches. One way to do that is to find additional tutorials to guide you through your discovery, a few of our favorites are:

- [Predict flight delays by creating a machine learning model in Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/predict-flight-delays-with-python?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner)
- [Build AI solutions with Azure Machine Learning service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-ai-solutions-with-azure-ml-service/)
